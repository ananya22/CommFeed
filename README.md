mid current lockdown scenario, many under privileged people like migrant worker, daily wage laborers, street beggars are finding it hard to manage food which is very basic necessity to stay alive. In this time of adversity, many individuals/organization are running community kitchens to provide foods to the needy. However, due to lack of synchronization, the benefits are not reaching to some segments of population in need while there is food shortage /wastage across some communities.  We aim to bridge this demand and supply gap by crowdsourcing information of the people in need an provide proper alignment planning to the community kitchen within vicinity and across locations (in case there is food shortage/spillover).‚Äù
